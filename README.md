### About Me
Hello! I am an experienced biology student and biotechnology/biopharmaceutical sciences professional-in-training with over three years of hands-on academic experience in biological sciences and research-based laboratory work.

With skills in lab techniques, data analysis, research skills, and Microsoft/Adobe tools, I am able to analyze complex data, conduct experiments, and achieve reliable, accurate results. I am adept at using Excel, Microsoft Office, and Adobe applications.

My detail-oriented, motivated, innovative, and collaborative skill set, commitment to high-quality scientific work, and passion for biotechnology make me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to travel and try new food places, as well as read.

### Projects

#### Inventory Management System

-  Initial project idea:
 I designed an inventory management system for a fictional business called Natalie’s Jewelry Boutique. I created a worksheet that could track jewelry items, their costs, and their profitability. Small business owners sometimes struggle with organizing and calculating profit margins. They also have trouble identifying their best and worst-performing items. This project makes it easier.

Tools I used:
I used Microsoft Excel to complete this project.

Challenges I faced:
One challenge I faced was getting the formulas to work correctly. This took some trial and error. I fixed the issues by double-checking my functions and adjusting my formatting. 

Other Resources:
I did not use any outside resources besides the lecture notes discussed in class to complete the project.

Result:
My workbook includes 15 jewelry items in categories such as rings, necklaces, bracelets, luxury pieces, and everyday pieces. I calculated the estimated profit, fixed fees, and net profit for every item. I added logic to decide whether margins should increase. I also identified the highest-profit and lowest-profit items. Also, I created a pie chart to show the category distribution.

Summary:
This project uses Excel to build an inventory for a jewelry boutique. It used formulas, functions, and logic to calculate profits, show trends, and show how specific items were performing.

#### Course Grade Evaluator

- Initial Project Idea:
 I created a Course Grade Evaluator program using Python in JDoodle. I made an evaluator that lets students enter their own weight factors for quizzes and assessments. This helps students calculate unweighted and weighted averages and see what letter grade they would receive in the future.

Tools I Used:
I used the Python code in JDoodle to complete it. It included loops and conditional statements. It asked students to enter quiz and assessment weights. It checked if the weights were valid and added up to 100%. The program then calculated unweighted and weighted averages and displayed the letter grade.

Challenges I Faced:
A challenge I faced was getting the code to run without errors. I kept getting incorrect outputs because some conditions and inputs were wrong. I fixed this by adjusting my conditional statements and testing inputs.

Other Resources:
I used examples from class, my notes, and instructional videos.

Result:
My final program was successful. It showed the quiz and assessment weights and checked if they added up to 100%. It repeated the questions until the student entered valid inputs. Once the weights were correct, it calculated the quiz average, assessment average, unweighted average, and weighted average. It also displayed the correct letter grade.

Summary:
This project uses Python to create a Course Grade Evaluator that checks weight inputs, calculates averages, and determines letter grades.

#### Aporto Virtual Lab

- Initial Project Idea:
For this project, I created a student database in the Aporto Virtual Lab. It included students, their grades, courses, and semesters. I was able to learn how to organize data and create transcripts. The problem I tried to solve was learning how to connect different pieces of information using queries.

Tools I Used:
I used Aporto Virtual Lab to create tables and enter student information. I linked each student to their grades and built queries to connect the data. I also made formatted transcripts and exported them as PDFs.

Challenges I Faced:
Working with queries was completely new to me. It was hard to understand how the data connects across different tables. It was also challenging to pull the correct information in my results. I overcame this by using class videos to guide me through creating tables, queries, and reports.

Other Resources:
I used class videos, but I completed the project on my own. These videos helped me understand how to build queries and reports.

Result:
I created a database with 10 students and their course and grade information over two or three years. I linked each student to their grades and built queries to get the data I needed. I also created two transcript PDFs that included semesters and overall GPAs. 

Summary:
This project taught me how to build a database in Aporto, link data across tables, use queries to connect information, and create transcripts.
