### About Me
Hello! I am an experienced biology student and biotechnology/biopharmaceutical sciences professional-in-training with over three years of hands-on academic experience in biological sciences and research-based laboratory work.

With skills in lab techniques, data analysis, research skills, and Microsoft/Adobe tools, I am able to analyze complex data, conduct experiments, and achieve reliable, accurate results. I am adept at using Excel, Microsoft Office, and Adobe applications.

My detail-oriented, motivated, innovative, and collaborative skill set, commitment to high-quality scientific work, and passion for biotechnology make me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to travel and try new food places, as well as read.
